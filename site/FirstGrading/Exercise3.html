          <ol type="A">
              <u><b><li>Pretend you have a poor internet connection.</li></u></b>
              <ul><li>When your instructor called you immediately download file that use up huge bandwidth or better yet, turn off any internet connection you have.</li></ul>
              <u><b><li>Pretend you do not have a microphone/webcam.</li></b></u>
              <ul><li>Type in your chatbox that your microphone isn't working. Although, you can't just say your microphone isn't working when you spoke using your mic in a roll call attendance.</li></ul>
              <u><b><li>Remove game activity in your Discord, especially, if you are friends with your instructor.</li></b></u>
              <ul><li>No explanation needed. Don't be stupid.</li></ul>
              <u><b><li>When called, become nonexistent.</li></b></u>
              <ul><li>If there is a recitation and you are called, do not answer. As if you never exist in the first place. As if you are just a flowing air waiting to be breathe in and out. As if this lifetime isn't yours to be born on. That, or just simply leave the conference call.</li></ul>
              <li><u><b>Form an alliance.</b></u></li>
              <ul><li>Teamwork is always the answer. While you were in an exam or quiz, be in a group call or something with your alliance and when you fail, at least you're not alone. Besides, would you rather fail and blame yourself or fail and blame other people? </li></ul>
              <li><u><b>Train your lying skills.</b></u></li>
              <ul><li>Not only will you need it for online classes, you would also need this for your resume when you end up not learning and achieving anything.</li></ul>
              <li><u><b>Learn when to stop.</b></u></li>
              <ul><li>When your webcam is needed and there is an impromptu essay or speech you need to do, just simply freeze. Like you are buffering or having a connection problem. And pray that your mother won't pass by at the background.</li></ul>
              <li><u><b>Essay? Easy.</b></u></li>
              <ul><li>Copy and paste it into a paraphrasing app or something and then boom, you can replace Shakespeare with your poetic and deep English words along with your outstanding plagiarized work that you probably shouldn't brag about your friends.</li></ul>
              <li><u><b>Have courage.</b></u></li>
              <ul><li>Sooner or later you will have to face the consequences. Have courage, if that time comes. Learn how to apologize in any different languages as possible to your mother.</li></ul>
              <li><u><b>Save money.</b></u></li>
              <ul><li>And when your parents decided to disown you. Not my problem anymore. Go to another website that give instructions on how to make money.</li></ul>
            </ol>
