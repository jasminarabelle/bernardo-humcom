                        <br>Learning (AI/ML) for staying ahead of the curve. What is important for 
                        <br>being effective for applying algorithms in coding to utilize data to 
                        <br>solve problems?
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Blockchain</b>, is a technology that uses a sequential set of transactions 
                        <br>leaving a defined register of events and process for combining tasks. Fusing AI/ML 
                        <br>and blockchain for data solutions is coming.
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Cloud</b>, is scalable and virtual environments. These are available to set users with 
                        <br>no physical location or provision requirement. Cloud creates a different model for 
                        <br>IT and data services by not restricting architecture by physical requirements.
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Ethical Artificial Intelligence</b>, is a field, study, and implementation of framework 
                        <br>for limiting or eliminating bias in algorithms. This involves evaluating a solution 
                        <br>for data use and implementation for cultural and social impact.
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Interoperability</b>, using APIs and libraries together through replication or scripting 
                        <br>across stacks for easy implementations. Having reusable and expandable blocks for 
                        <br>coding across platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft 
                        <br>Azure, SAP, Snowflake, and more.
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Security</b>, keeping data safe through stewardship. Both innovation and workflow 
                        <br>will be a topic for 2021 to enhance security methods for specialized data 
                        <br>services based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to differentiate 
                        <br>from software development norms.
                        <br>
                        <br>The way to stay ahead is to know the list of technologies that touch a domain and 
                        <br>achieve proficiency in them for incorporation into tasks to maintain productivity. 
                        <br>The five themes for 2021 for maintaining relevance in AI/ML: Blockchain, 
                        <br>Cloud, Ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI), Interoperability, 
                        <br>and Security (Cybersecurity).

            <font size="3px" color="black">Institutions, especially in health care, are working to lower the exposure of Covid-19 
               <br> to patients and workers. Many private and public practices have started implementing more 
               <br>telehealth offerings such as doctor-patient video chats, A.I. avatar-based diagnostics, 
               <br>and no-contact-based medication delivery.
               <br>
               <br>Telehealth visits have surged by 50 percent compared with pre-pandemic levels. IHS Technology predicted that 70 million Americans would use telehealth by 2020. Since then, Forrester Research predicted the number of U.S. virtual care visits will reach almost a billion early in 2021.
               <br>
               <br>Teladoc Health, Amwell, Livongo Health, One Medical, and Humana are some of the public 
               <br>companies offering telehealth services to meet the current needs. Startups are not far behind. Startups like MDLive, MeMD, iCliniq, K Health, 98point6, Sense.ly, and Eden Health have also contributed toward meeting the growing needs in 2020, and will continue offering creative solutions in 2021. Beyond telehealth, in 2021 we can expect to see health care advancements in biotech and A.I., as well as machine learning opportunities (example: Suki AI) to support diagnosis, admin work, and robotic health care.
