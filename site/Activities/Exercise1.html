            <h3><center><u><font face="Bebas Kai" color='#5F9EA0' size='5pt'>Percy Jackson & the Olympians Series </font></u>
           Author: <u>Rick Riordan</u> </h3></center>
            <h4><u>Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson</u> series played a huge role for people who love of Greek mythology – the <font color= 'red'><i><b>modern</i></b></font> take on heroes and myths make them easier for a young audience to understand, and there are plenty of Easter eggs for those who already know their myths. The Lightning Thief kicks off the series <font color= 'red'><i><b>wonderfully</i></b></font>, introducing a <font color= 'red'><i><b>loveable</i></b></font> cast of characters that will stay with you for a long time.

                <u>Percy</u> is a hero who’s <font color= 'red'><i><b>brave and loyal</i></b></font> for all the right reasons – his love for his family, both blood and found, make him a <font color= 'red'><i><b>genuine and lovable</i></b></font> protagonist. He isn’t the kind of hero who is unwilling dragged through his own story; he becomes immersed in this world along with the reader, and he quickly comes to love his <font color= 'red'><i><b>fantastical new</i></b></font> life and the people that come with it. The supporting cast is just as <font color= 'red'><i><b>strong and substantial</i></b></font>: <u>Annabeth</u> is never reduced to a damsel-in-distress, and she’s admired for her intelligence and strength rather than looks.
