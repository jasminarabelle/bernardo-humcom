                <b>The First Law Trilogy</b>
                <br>Joe Abercrombie 
                <br> Artwork by: Raymond Swanland & John McCoy
                <p>Abercrombie's characters are amazing and full of depth, and you're 
                    never quite sure what they're going to do because they're all so human, 
                    imperfect and prone to mistakes. There are no simple evildoers, 
                    no clear villains, no clear allies or rivals. Not only can we, 
                    as readers, ponder through them, but Abercrombie does a remarkably 
                    good job at making each character see the others through completely 
                    different lenses. So, while one character may be hated by all his 
                    old friends, he is seen as "the greatest man I know" by anyone he 
                    met later in his life, in another place and time.</p>
                    <p>The plot itself is immense, at the same time as the best 
                        epic fantasy, and surprisingly concentrated at the same 
                        time. The conflict unfolds on a variety of occasions at 
                        once. Whereas George R. R. Martin's novels do not have 
                        completely straightforward heroes and villains, the stakes 
                        are very clear. We're rooted for the good guys, even though 
                        the good guys aren't really good. The same cannot be said 
                        for the trilogy of the First Law. Indeed, we're going into 
                        books with certain preconceived ideas, and nearly all of 
                        them are damaged, not only skewed but completely shattered.</p>

                <b>The Wilds</b>
                <br>Sarah Streicher
                <p>A group of young women are on a chartered flight to Hawaii 
                    for a troubled girl's retreat named The Dawn of Eve when 
                    the plane goes down, killing the crew and stranding 
                    passengers on an island in the middle of nowhere. 
                    When each episode cuts back and forth between the time 
                    after the island and the time before it—usually cut back 
                    on discovering the story of each girl one per chapter—the 
                    "Lost" comparison is direct and clear, particularly as 
                    teenagers find that there is more about where they are and 
                    how they ended up there than it first seems. And some of 
                    the girls have taken secrets to the middle of nowhere. 
                    When we learn more and more about the stranded teenagers, 
                    their identities begin to separate themselves from each other. 
                    If there's a lead, it's potentially Leah who gets the first 
                    flashback episode and gets the suspicion that things aren't 
                    what they appear to be on the island, but the show is really 
                    balanced with the group.</p>

                <b>Valorant</b>
                <br>Riot Games
                <br>Artwork by: ExCharny 
                <p>Valorant is a team-based tactical shooter and first-person shooter 
                    set to operate in the near future. Plays play as one of a series of 
                    agents, characters based on a variety of countries and cultures around 
                    the world. In main game mode, players are assigned either to the 
                    attacking or defensive side, each team having five players on it. 
                    Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a 
                    unique ultimate capability that involves charging from kills, deaths, 
                    or spike acts. Each player begins each round with a "classic" weapon 
                    and one or more "signature capability" charges. Other arms and capacity 
                    charges can be bought using an in-game economic structure that rewards 
                    money depending on the results of the previous round. The game has a 
                    variety of firearms from secondary weapons such as side arms and main 
                    weapons such as submachine guns, handguns, machine guns, assault rifles 
                    and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons with 
                    a shooting method that must be controlled by the player in order to be 
                    able to fire correctly.</p>
